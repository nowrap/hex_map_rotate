# hex_map_rotate
A NodeJS rotator making hex maps compatible with [Pathfinder Kingmaker Adventure Path](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kingmaker_(adventure_path)) capable of reading our MediaWiki and uploading the generated map.

It creates a SVG and a PDF based from the [Kingmaker Playerguide](https://paizo.com/products/btpy8dqh?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Kingmaker-Players-Guide).

## credits
The original perl based tool is from https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/hex-mapping and included as a git submodule.

All icons are from the fabulous [noun project](https://thenounproject.com/).
